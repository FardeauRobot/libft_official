# Changes in this update

- Replaced increment/decrement style with `i++`/`i--` and kept functions within
  the 25-line norm while avoiding prefix increments.
- Removed the `sorting/` directory and its related documentation until a later
  rework.
- Cleaned leftover test comments from source files and ensured lines stay under
  80 characters.
- Updated README with submodule usage instructions and refreshed docs to match
  the current folder layout.
